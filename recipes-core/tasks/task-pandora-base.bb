DESCRIPTION = "Task file for base OpenPandora specific bits like libPND and firmware"

# Note: This task assumes your building an X image and will pull in an XServer and all that jazz.
# TODO: Break down again into GUI and CLI aspects like the classic trees, more testing needed 1st.

# Don't forget to bump the PR if you change it.
