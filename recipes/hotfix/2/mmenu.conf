# for the mmenu 'minimenu'
#

# Note on overriding whats in a .pnd-application/PXML.xml
# Note that you can perform icon name, clockspeed setting and category overrides via an .ovr file
# Note that the icon can be overridden for a pnd-file by making a same-name .png file, in the same location
# "Notes" can be added to an icon using the .ovr file, as well.

# Skins
# There is a a searchpath to find skin subdirs in; built in skins are in /etc/pandora/mmenu/skins,
# so any subdirectory of that is a skin-name. (ie: /etc/pandora/mmenu/skins/default is skin named 'default')
# Each skin will have its own mmskin.conf file defining how the skin works. All other options should be
# here, so that skin-changes do not break user preferences
